# Performance Framework The aim of this project is to provide common tools for the measuring of code run time.# APIThe library provides the following set of macros:- The TIC(name) ... TOC(name) pair for measuring the run time of the instructions (in seconds or milliseconds, depending on the configuration options) that are placed between the opening TIC macro and closing TOC macro. Unlimited number of nested blocs of TIC ... TOC pairs is supported.Example:Source:```cppint a;for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i){TIC(sum);a = a + 2;TOC(sum);}```Output (numbers are just for example):```sum: 1e-10 sum: 1e-10sum: 1e-10```- The TIME(name) ... EMIT(name) pair for measuring the __average__ run time (between several calls) of the instructions that are placed between the opening macro and closing macro. Unlimited number of nested blocs of macro pairs is supported.Example:Source:```cppint a;for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i){TIME(sum);a = a + 2;EMIT(sum);}```Output (numbers are just for example):```NAME    N CALLS    TOTAL    AVERAGEsum     3          3e-10    1e-10```# Output formatThe library supports the following output formats:- plain text table (as in second example)- Github Flavored Markdown table (see https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables)- YAML (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)#Notes- You may be interested in using `#` and `##` operators in C macros (see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/replace)<!-- - You may be interested in using destructor of the class for code execution on the variable exiting out of scope --><!-- - You may be interested in `extern` variables -->
